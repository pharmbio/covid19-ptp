# Hangout 2020-03-31, 

- Attending: @jonalv, @samuell
- We decided to:
  - Go with ExcapeDB.
  - Skip adding things from the new ChEMBL, as we would then need to redo a lot
    of filtering and canonization that they've done with ExcapeDB.
  - CPSign is updated with some new names on flags etc.
  - Jonathan to update the CPSign commands together with Staffan.
  - Jonathan or Ola to send CPSign license to Samuel.
  - Samuel to implement most of the workflow (based on the earlier PTP pipeline).
  - Go with the targets from table 3 and 4 in Gordon et al.
