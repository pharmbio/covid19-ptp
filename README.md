Predicted Target Profile towards proteins of interest for Covid-19
==================================================================

This is a project aimed at running a similar pipeline like in the [PTP
project](https://github.com/pharmbio/ptp-project) on data for the Covid-19
disease, caused by the Coronavirus.

The basic idea is to use the 67 druggable human protein targets reported in
[this study](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002386) to develop predictive
models for them, based on binding data for those proteins in open datasets.
